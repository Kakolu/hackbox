			By choosing to adopt a pet from a shelter, you are saving a life. Plus, no matter what type of dog or cat you’re looking for, you’re sure to find your new best friend at a shelter, where there are wonderful pets of every breed, size and age. You can also adopt from the Best Friends Pet Adoption and Spay/Neuter Center in Mission Hills or our NKLA Pet Adoption Center in West L.A. Each pet at the center comes from a Los Angeles shelter or our Kitten Nursery and is vaccinated, spayed or neutered, and microchipped before going to a new home.

			Have you addressed what type of pet personality you are looking for? Wait a second, did we just say personality, and not breed? Yes, that is right. Finding the ideal pet for yourself or family should start with an understanding of the ideal pet personality. Consider this, do you need a dog that is low key and good with kids, or are you looking for an energetic pal who is into trail running? Perhaps a cat that will get along well with others is what you need. The dog rescues and cat rescues that post hundreds of local pets near you are experts at matching you with a dog or cat who will love the life you can provide. This is why so many people are realizing focusing on dog adoption and cat adoption from a rescue is the ideal pet search process. Best of all, our website has a feature called "Search Saver." Simply tell us what you are looking for and we will e-mail you when that perfect pet is available! So even if you've made the commitment to adopt a puppy or adopt a kitten, we will e-mail you immediately when we know of a local little furry fellow who is in need of a new home!

			Each year, millions of dogs and cats are killed in our nation's shelters. But it doesn't have to be that way. An estimated 17 million people will add a new pet to their families this year. If more of them would choose to adopt a pet, instead of buying one, we could reduce the number of animals killed in shelters significantly.
